Troffxml - nroff processors to build xml files.
===============================================

Presentation
------------

Troffxml provides a solution to build an xml file from a troff
document that rely on nroff. A nroff macro (for example ux, from
utmac) is used to build a flat text of the document which contains
tags that a postprocessor (postxml) will convert to xml. A
preprocessor (prexml) escapes these tags if they are present in the
source document.  A final xslt processor will translate the xml file
to a famous xml format.

	prexml < file.tr | nroff -Tutf8 ‐mux | postxml > file.xml
	xsltproc utohtml.xsl file.xml > file.html
	xsltproc utofodt.xsl file.xml > file.fodt

Build and install
-----------------

These tools have not been tested with the Groff implementation of
nroff, so you probably need to install heirloom nroff, from
<https://github.com/n-t-roff/heirloom-doctools>.

To build and install run:

    make
    make install

To uninstall and clean, run:

    make uninstall
    make clean
