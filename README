# Presentation
==============

Troffxml provide a solution to build an xml file from a troff
document that rely on nroff. A nroff macro (for example ux, from
utmac) is used to build a flat text of the document which contain
tags that a postprocessor (postxml) will convert to xml. A
preprocessor (prexml) escape these tags if they are present in
the source document. A final pipe program (trxtr) will translate
the xml file to a famous xml format.
